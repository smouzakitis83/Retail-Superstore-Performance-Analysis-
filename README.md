# Retail-Superstore-Performance-Analysis-
Analyzed a U.S. super retail store with locations nationwide to evaluate sales and profitability. Using SQL, I created calculated metrics for profit, discount-related revenue loss, adjusted sale price, and unit-level revenue and profit. Insights are presented in an interactive Tableau dashboard with state-level sales and profit visuals.
