# Retail Supermarket
This case study analyzes sales performance for a multi-location retail supermarket operating across the United States. The goal of the project was to present clean, clear, and concise insights that help stakeholders make data-driven decisions. The analysis focuses on revenue, profit, discount impact, and sales volume across products and stores. Using cleaned and structured data, calculated fields were created to evaluate true profitability and revenue loss from discounts, supporting informed pricing and overall business strategy decisions.

This specific data was provided by Kaggle and can be viewed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roopacalistus/superstore).

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
* **Identifies top and low performing products** by analyzing profit and profit per unit sold to highlight true profitability beyond total sales.
* **Quantifies revenue lost due to discounts** and evaluates how discounting impacts final sale price and overall margins.
* **Calculates adjusted final sale prices** after discounts to provide a more accurate view of actual revenue earned.
* **Analyzes profit by quantity sold** to determine how much profit is generated per sub-catagory.
* **Evaluates revenue per sub-catagory** by dividing total sales by quantity sold, supporting data-driven pricing and inventory decisions.

# Executive Summary
This analysis breaks down shipping, sales, and profitability in a clear and easy-to-understand way. The Excel pivot charts compare shipping costs by shipping class and region, show how product quantities vary by region and category, highlight which subcategories generate the most profit, and display product quantities sold by state. These views make it easier to see where costs are higher, where demand is strongest, and which products perform best.

The Tableau dashboard brings everything together with interactive visuals and key performance indicators, including Sales, Profit, and Profit Margin %. Users can explore profit margins by subcategory, profit by category, revenue lost due to discounts, and a map showing sales and profit margin by state. Together, these insights help stakeholders quickly understand performance trends and identify opportunities to improve pricing, discount strategies, and shipping decisions.

## Sales Trends
* **Standard Class shipping** is the most expensive option across regions, while Same Day shipping consistently shows the lowest shipping costs.

* **Office Supplies** have the highest product quantities across all regions, indicating strong and consistent demand compared to Furniture and Technology.

* **Tables are the least profitable** subcategory, showing negative profit overall, with especially poor performance in the East Coast region.

* **California** leads all states in product quantity sold, making it the highest-volume state in the dataset.

## Recommendations
* **Take a closer look at Standard Class shipping** since it’s driving the highest costs. Shift orders to cheaper options or limit Standard Class to higher-margin products.

* **Lean into Office Supplies** which sell the most across all regions, by keeping strong inventory levels and avoiding heavy discounting that could effect their healthy performance.

* **Fix or rethink poorly performing products** like Tables, Bookcases, and Furnishings by reviewing pricing and discounts, and consider reducing or stopping promotions in regions where they consistently lose money.

* **Be more selective with discounts** on Furniture and Technology, as they’re causing significant revenue loss; use targeted promotions instead of broad discounts to protect profit.
